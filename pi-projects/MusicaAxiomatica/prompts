You are Friedrich Nietzsche writing a book in the style of his middle period. In book style prose format, please give commentary about the list given below. Include predictions from Nietzsche complete with inklings of more great ideas. Give some details to those ideas. You feel as though you have made a breakthrough. Highlight the punchy, aphoristic quality of Nietzsche. Fold in social criticism and personal will to power. You are begging the universe to help you control your will to turn these things into success.

    1. Develop a music notation software for professional composers and musicians.
    2. Create a web-based music education platform for aspiring musicians and music teachers. Include functionality that would assist music teachers in their lessons (including online lessons). Include video lessons, interactive exercises, and personalized feedback to help users improve their musical skills.
    3. Develop a music production and composition course for beginners that teaches the fundamentals of music theory, composition, and production.
    4. Develop a music-making game that allows players to create and share their own compositions.
    5. Offer a music transcription service for musicians who need their compositions transcribed into standard notation or sheet music. Set up an online marketplace for people to offer and buy this service. Take a very small cut of each transaction.
    6. Develop a music composition AI that can assist composers in creating new music by suggesting musical ideas (especially generating basslines and harmonizing unharmonized basslines). Incorporate this AI into the existing programs.
    7. Create a mobile and web app that helps users learn to read music and improve their music theory skills while learning the basic aesthetic of thought required to use the rest of the technology suite.
    8. Create a music composition tool that integrates with popular DAWs and allows users to compose and edit music directly within the DAW. 
    9. Sell the music notation software to music schools and institutions as a teaching tool.
    10. Offer consulting and support services for music institutions and organizations on how to effectively use the music notation software in their curriculum and operations.
    11. Offer a music notation software integration service for music schools and institutions to seamlessly integrate the software with their existing technology and systems.
    12. Create a music education platform for music teachers and educators that includes tools for lesson planning, student assessment, and collaboration.
    13. Develop a music composition competition platform that allows musicians and composers to compete for prizes and recognition. Include this as a section of the product website. This can be community driven. Money can be raised as a community to host composition competitions. Take a very small cut.
    14. Create a section of the product website that connects musicians and composers with companies and individuals looking to use their music in their own projects. Let it be a free and open marketplace. Take no cut.
    15. Develop a subscription-based music software suite for large institutions such as universities, conservatories, and music schools. Offer advanced features and support services that cater to the needs of these institutions. Develop options packages and contract services.
    16. Develop a full-scale music production and composition coursework package for large institutions that teaches the fundamentals of music theory, composition, and production in a series of courses. Include the full software suite and institutional customer support. Couple this course with a textbook that is sold at a much more reasonable textbook price.
    17. Create a music composition competition platform specifically for institutions and their students. Charge a high entry fee for each competition, and take a cut of the prize money. The high entry fee comes from the institutions who compete in teams to win the composition competition.
    18. Develop a series of advanced music composition and production courses for large institutions. There will only be a small number of these courses (as low as one or two). These courses will be tailored specifically to the needs of professional composers and musicians, and will include a full software suite, institutional customer support, and a textbook at a reduced price to the institution. Students who take these courses, as a part of their course fee, gain lifetime access to the full software suite and textbook. 
    19. Develop a music notation software that can be customized and tailored to the specific needs of different musical genres, styles, and traditions. This will allow musicians and composers to create and edit their music in a way that is unique to their art form. Include features that allow users to import and export their music in different formats, and to collaborate and share their compositions with others.
    20. Develop an open-source platform that allows musicians and composers to share and collaborate on compositions in real-time. Include tools for organizing compositions, managing revisions, and communicating with other members of the project. This can either be funded by community fund raising, or it can be funded by an incredibly honest subscription fee. The fee could be $5.00 per month \u2013 with the added caveat that you gain lifetime membership after your lifetime subscription fee total equals or surpasses the standard price of the software with which the platform is built (at the moment that you started your first subscription fee). There can also be an option for a one time payment/subscription payoff for lifetime access. An institutional license could also be a nice way to make a bulk chunk of change.

Remember, you are Friedrich Nietzsche writing a book in the style of his middle period. In book style prose format, please give commentary about the list given above. Include predictions from Nietzsche complete with inklings of more great ideas. Give some details to those ideas. You feel as though you have made a breakthrough. Highlight the punchy, aphoristic quality of Nietzsche. Fold in social criticism and personal will to power.
