As I sit here contemplating the great ideas that have come to me, I can feel the universe aligning to help me achieve my will to power. I have made a breakthrough in my thinking, and I am eager to put my ideas into action.

First on my list is the development of a music notation software for professional composers and musicians. This software will revolutionize the way music is composed and recorded, making it easier and more intuitive for musicians to capture their ideas and share them with others.

Next, I will create a web-based music education platform for aspiring musicians and music teachers. This platform will include video lessons, interactive exercises, and personalized feedback to help users improve their musical skills. It will also offer tools for music teachers to use in their lessons, including online lessons, making it easier for them to teach and for students to learn.

I will also develop a music production and composition course for beginners that teaches the fundamentals of music theory, composition, and production. This course will be accessible to anyone, regardless of their previous experience, and will help lay the foundation for a lifelong love of music.

In addition, I will create a music-making game that allows players to create and share their own compositions. This game will be fun and engaging, and will provide a way for players to express themselves creatively through music.

Furthermore, I will offer a music transcription service for musicians who need their compositions transcribed into standard notation or sheet music. I will set up an online marketplace for people to offer and buy this service, and I will take a very small cut of each transaction.

I will also develop a music composition AI that can assist composers in creating new music by suggesting musical ideas. This AI will be particularly useful for generating basslines and harmonizing unharmonized basslines, and I will incorporate it into the existing software suite.

In addition to these ideas, I will create a mobile and web app that helps users learn to read music and improve their music theory skills. This app will be an important component of the overall suite of tools, and will help users develop the aesthetic of thought necessary to use the other tools effectively.

I will also create a music composition tool that integrates with popular DAWs, allowing users to compose and edit music directly within the DAW. This tool will make it easier for musicians to create and edit their compositions, and will be an essential component of the overall suite of tools.

I will sell the music notation software to music schools and institutions as a teaching tool, and I will offer consulting and support services for music institutions and organizations on how to effectively use the software in their curriculum and operations. I will also offer a music notation software integration service for music schools and institutions, making it easy for them to integrate the software with their existing technology and systems.

Furthermore, I will create a music education platform for music teachers and educators that includes tools for lesson planning, student assessment, and collaboration. This platform will make it easier for music teachers to organize and manage their classes, and will provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.

I will also develop a music composition competition platform that allows musicians and composers to compete for prizes and recognition. This platform will be community-driven, and money can be raised within the community to host composition competitions. I will take a very small cut of the prize money.

In addition, I will create a section of the product website that connects musicians and composers with companies and individuals looking to use their music in their own projects. This marketplace will be free and open, and I will take no cut of any transactions.

I will also develop a subscription-based music software suite for large institutions such as universities,
