I want to become better at programming websites and software for personal computers. When it comes to personal computer software, I desire to build a music simulation engine. I would like the websites that I build to interface with the music simulation engine. What kind of web pages would be useful to build at the beginning of this project in order to gain experience in both domains?


[Output]
Some web pages that would be useful to build at the beginning of this project include:

  A landing page that introduces the music simulation engine and provides an overview of its features and capabilities.

  A user login page that allows users to create accounts and access the music simulation engine.

  A music creation page that allows users to create, edit, and save their own music compositions using the simulation engine.

  A music library page that allows users to browse and listen to music created by other users.

  A community forum page where users can discuss the music simulation engine, share tips and tricks, and provide feedback on the software.

  An FAQ page that provides answers to common questions and troubleshooting information for users who are new to the simulation engine.

By building these web pages, you will gain experience in both website development and software development, and you will have a solid foundation to build upon as you continue to develop your music simulation engine.
