In today's world, we are seeing a proliferation of technology in the realm of music. From music notation software to web-based education platforms, it seems as though the possibilities are endless. However, I fear that this obsession with technology is leading to the deterioration of social institutions and the devaluation of true musical talent and skill.

While some of the ideas listed above may be useful for certain individuals or institutions, I fear that they will ultimately lead to a homogenization of musical expression and a reliance on artificial intelligence and automation. The music-making game, for example, may provide entertainment, but it will not foster the critical thinking and creativity necessary for true musical innovation.

Furthermore, the notion of a music transcription service and a music composition AI suggests a laziness and lack of discipline in the pursuit of musical mastery. True musicians should strive to develop their own skills and techniques, not rely on technology to do the work for them.

In addition, the focus on selling these technologies to institutions and offering consulting and support services commodifies music education and detracts from its inherent value. Music should not be treated as a product to be bought and sold, but as a fundamental aspect of human culture and expression.

While I do not deny the potential benefits of some of these technological advancements, I urge caution in their implementation and a return to a focus on true musical skill and creativity. Only then can we avoid the erosion of our musical heritage and the devaluation of the art form.
